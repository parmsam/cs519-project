## Title
Interactive choropleth of COVID-19 measures across the USA

## Project Aim
The aim of the project is to develop an interactive choropleth of COVID-19 measures across the USA at the county-level using JHU CSSE COVID-19 Data published on Github (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). Choropleth visualizations will be generated for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries which the user can toggle through, with an option for the user a slider to toggle through dates. Additionally, tooltips will show up when the user hovers over the county map with an optional zoom.
